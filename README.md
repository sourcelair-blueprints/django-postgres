# Django + PostgreSQL project template

Get started with a new Django project, powered by PostgreSQL, on [SourceLair](https://www.sourcelair.com/home).

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started is by visiting http://lair.io/stacks/django-postgres and starting a new SourceLair project with a single click.

This will do the following on your behalf:

1. create a new SourceLair project for your Django + PostgreSQL app
2. clone the code from this Git repository
3. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all needed dependencies (this might take a few minutes)
4. start the Django development server (`python manage.py runserver`) and expose it to your public URL

## Tips

- edit your files using SourceLair's fully-featured editor
- run commands (e.g. `python manage.py migrate`) in SourceLair's Linux terminal
- view and test your Django app using your public URL (click on the _eye_ icon in the sidebar)
- in case you need any help contact SourceLair using the _envelope_ icon in the sidebar or send an email to [support@sourcelair.com](mailto:support@sourcelair.com)
